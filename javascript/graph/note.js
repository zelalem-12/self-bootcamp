/*
The most common implementation of graph is 
    #1. Find the path between two nodes.
    #2. Find the shortest path from one node to another. 
    #3. Find the shortest path that vists all nodes // traveling salesman problem is an example of this example 


// The two most method to search a data in a tree and graph data structure is 
    #1. Breadth(level) first search   
    #2. Depth first search
